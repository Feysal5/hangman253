## Project Description

The Hangman Game Project is a Python-based implementation of the classic hangman word guessing game. The project utilizes Python's capabilities to create an interactive and entertaining game.

### Aim of the Project

The primary goal of this project is to build a functional Hangman game that allows users to guess a word letter by letter. The project focuses on integrating user input, random word selection, and input validation.

### What You Will Learn

- Generating random words in Python.
- Taking user input and validating it.
- Structuring a simple game program.
- Incorporating functions and modular code.

## Installation

To run the Hangman Game, you need Python installed on your machine. You can clone this repository to your local environment using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman-project.git

##Usage
Once the game is running, follow the on-screen instructions to guess letters and play the game. The game will continue until the player either correctly guesses the word or runs out of attempts.
